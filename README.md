## Our Vision

> Create a comprehensive manual for Kubernetes Cluster Security Assessment

We are creating a comprehensive testing guide for Kubernetes cluster security assessment that covers a top down approach to assess the security of a cluster. The guide include methodology, tools, techniques and procedures (TTP) to execute an assessment that enables a tester to deliver consistent and complete results.
